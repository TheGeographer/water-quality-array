# water-quality-array
This repostity contains the Arduino and Android code for University of Wisconsin-Whitewater water quality array used in the "Testing the Waters" event in May 2016 in cooperation with the Rock River Coalition.
The Android apps were built using MIT App Inventor 2 Beta (nb155 Component Release, available at http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu) and the exported .aia are available here. To replicate, use the "Import" functionality within App Inventor to import these projects.
The Arduino code was built using the Arduino IDE (version 1.6.8, available at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and requires the following libraries (all available in the standard Arduino IDE repository):
1. OneWire
2. DallasTemperature
3. Wire
4. SoftwareSerial
